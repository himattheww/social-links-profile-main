## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid
- Font Inter from Google Fonts

### What I learned

During this project, I learned about:
- Using rem units for better accessibility and responsive design
- Creating hover effects with smooth transitions
- Implementing a dark theme using CSS variables
- Working with Google Fonts
- Building responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes

Key takeaways about rem usage:
```css
/* Example of rem implementation */
.profile-card {
    padding: 2.5rem;  /* Using rem for spacing */
    max-width: 375px;
    width: 90%;
}

.social-link {
    padding: 1rem;    /* Consistent spacing with rem */
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
